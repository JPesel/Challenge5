## Overview of the analysis
During this analysis we processed a colection of data for the ride sharin app "Pyber", during thi analysis we discovered some insightful statistics that may come useful for the company's future. In this specific instance we analyzed the fares for each city type (Rural, Suburban and Urban) and how they stack against eachother.

## Results
![Table1](/analysis/table1.PNG)
As we can se in this table, the amount of rides, drivers and fares goes up as expected, but not at the same rate, this couses the average fare to be within the same order of magnitud (favoring the rural areas) and this gets aplified even more in the average Fare per Driver where the rural drivers make over 3 times as much as their urban counterparts.
