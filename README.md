## Overview of the analysis
During this analysis we processed a colection of data for the ride sharin app "Pyber", during thi analysis we discovered some insightful statistics that may come useful for the company's future. In this specific instance we analyzed the fares for each city type (Rural, Suburban and Urban) and how they stack against eachother.

## Results
![Table1](/analysis/table1.PNG)

As we can se in this table, the amount of rides, drivers and fares goes up as expected, but not at the same rate, this couses the average fare to be within the same order of magnitud (favoring the rural areas) and this gets aplified even more in the average Fare per Driver where the rural drivers make over 3 times as much as their urban counterparts.

Now in this chartwe can the that the sum of fares for each city type stays mostly constant over this period of time, with clearly the urban cities earing more, then the sub urban and lastly the rural cities.

## Summary
This are the business recomendation we are giving the CEO:

1. Limit the amount of drivers you have in the cities, you have more drivers than rides, this will make it so that you get to keep the best drivers stay in your service and they get payed more.
2. Incentivize people to join the program in rural areas, on average each driver completed 1.6 rides, if you get more drives you may be able to get to morre marketshare in this areas
3. maybe lowering the fare for rural areas will also increase usage in this areas and maybe even more people will sign up to be drivers as well.
